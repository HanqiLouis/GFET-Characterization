# üìä Google Colab Plotting & Analysis GUIs 

This repository contains **three interactive Google Colab notebooks** built for analyzing and visualizing Keithley measurement data:

1. **`Plot_all_Runs_GUI.ipynb`** ‚Äì Plot every individual data file from a selected site and overlay them on a single graph  
2. **`Plot_Average_GUI.ipynb`** ‚Äì Compute and visualize the average of all individual runs from a selected site  
3. **`DP_Boxplot_GUI.ipynb`** ‚Äì Generate boxplots summarizing the extracted values (e.g., Dirac Points) across multiple sites

## üßæ Requirements

These notebooks are meant to be used on **Google Colab** ‚Äì no local installation is required.

To run them successfully:

- You must be signed in to a **Google account**  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* EPFL accounts may cause issues with Drive access in Colab. A personal Google account is recommended.

---

## üìÅ Data Preparation

### üìÇ Where to store your files

- **Option 1 ‚Äì Upload in Colab**  
  Upload your files using the folder icon on the left toolbar in Colab.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *These files will be lost when the session ends.*

- **Option 2 ‚Äì Mount your personal Google Drive (Recommended)**  
  Create a folder in your Google Drive and store the data files there.  
  You can also use a shared Drive folder to collaborate with others.

To mount your Google Drive inside Colab, run this code at the top of the notebook:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Once mounted, your Drive content will be accessible under `/content/drive/MyDrive/`.


---

### üìÑ Expected File Format

These GUIs are designed to process **linear voltage sweeps on the gate** (with constant bias between gate and drain), measured using the **Keithley**.

Each measurement file must:

- Be a **.xlsx  file**. 
- Each file must contain a `VG` and a `ID` columns.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These column names (**VG** and **ID**) must **exactly** match this format (will both letters in uppercase) ‚Äî otherwise the scripts will fail to parse the data.
> Please make sure that they are named correctly when setting up the parameters in the Keithley.

---

### üìë File Naming and Ordering

Proper file order in the exported folder is **essential** to ensure proper site/run association. Please make sure that the files are ordered by sites and runs  
Example of correct order: Site@1Run1, Site@1Run2, Site@1Run3, Site@2Run1, Site@2Run2, Site@2Run3, ...  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Some Important Notes

- Recommended to **not modify the name** of the files when exported from the Keithley, as the default naming classify them already in the correct order
- All **sites must have the same number of runs**
- Only include **files intended for processing** (please remove all test runs or duplicate runs)
- Files must be **sorted in the correct order** to ensure proper site/run association.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Failing to follow this structure will likely result in **incorrect results or script errors**.
